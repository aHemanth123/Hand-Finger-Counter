#  Hand-Finger-Counter

A real-time finger counting and labeling system using **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV**.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project uses **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV** to detect a hand in real-time using a webcam and count the number of fingers raised. Each finger is individually labeled (e.g., **Thumb**, **Index**, etc.), and the total number of fingers is displayed on the screen.

## 🧠 How It Works

- **MediaPipe Hands** detects 21 landmarks per hand in real-time.
- **Finger Landmarks Used**:
  - **Thumb tip**: ID `4`
  - **Index tip**: ID `8`
  - **Middle tip**: ID `12`
  - **Ring tip**: ID `16`
  - **Pinky tip**: ID `20`
- Compares finger tip positions with previous joints to determine whether each finger is **up** or **down**.
- Labels each finger and displays the total raised fingers live on the video feed.
